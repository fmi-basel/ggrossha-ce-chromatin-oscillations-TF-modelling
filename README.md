This repository contains the R code that reproduces key figures from the manuscript "A scheduler for rhythmic gene expression". 

determineTimingTrajectoriesMoltSync.r
Contains the code the creates timing trajectories (circular plots) for the wildtype C. elegans larvae RNA-seq dataset

predictATAC_with_ChIP.r
Contains code for the various linear models used to predict ATAC-seq amplitude and phase from Transcrition factor (TF) ChIP data

fitLinearTfModelByTimepoint_grh1ATAC.r
Contains the code to fit the time point specific linear transcription factor model to the GRH-1 acute depletion ATAC-seq data.
